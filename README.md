=========

***This plugin is in its early stages and is not ready for use.***

Building the plugin
--------

1. Clone HaskForce.

1. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA.

1. Check out the Community Edition source files.

    ````$ git clone git@github.com:JetBrains/intellij-community.git idea````

1. Configure SDK and source files.
  * Create a new project from existing sources (pointed to your cloned HaskForce directory).
  * Go to File > Project Structure.  Add SDKs for JDK and IDEA Plugins.  For the IDEA Plugins, add sources
    from cloned IntelliJ to the Sourcepath.
1. Install and enable additional plugins.

Testing the plugin
--------

To run the tests:

  Run HaskellTestCase in tests/com/haskforce.

To add more tests:

  Edit Haskell*Test.java files to add more tests of the same kind that already
  exists. Edit HaskellTestCase.java if you need to add tests of a different
  kind.
